# MTG Arena Collection Exporter

This tool scans your game memory while MTG Arena is running to export your entire card collection.
It outputs two files:
- `mtga_collection.json`: Full data including card IDs and quantities.
- `mtga_collection.txt`: A readable list of your cards (Count + Name).

## How to use

### Option 1: Run the Executable (Simplest)
1. Navigate to **Releases**
2. Download and extract the **zip**
4. Navigate inside the extradted folder
5. Ensure **MTG Arena is running**.
6. Go to the **Decks** or **Collection** tab in-game, scroll for 30 secs through your collection (important so your collection loads into memory).
7. Run `MTGA_Exporter.exe`.
8. Follow the prompts to allow the tool do find and export your collection.

### Option 2: Run from Python Source
1. Download and extract zip
3. navigate inside folder
4. Install Python 3.x.
5. Run `install.bat` to install dependencies (`pymem`, `requests`).
6. Run `python mtg.py`.

## Troubleshooting
- If the tool cannot find your collection, ensure you have visited the Collection/Decks tab.
- Try providing different anchor cards if the first attempt fails (rarer anchor cards such as [O:legendary] work better, as they are more unique to your collection).
- Run as Administrator if you encounter permission errors.

## Filter & re-export by color (cross-platform GUI)

`mtga_export_gui.py` is a small Tkinter app that loads an existing
`mtga_collection.json` and lets you tick which colors (W/U/B/R/G/Colorless) to
include before re-exporting to TXT, JSON, or Moxfield-style CSV. It runs on
**macOS, Linux, and Windows** — only `mtg.py` itself is Windows-only (it scans
the live MTGA process via `pymem`, and MTG Arena has no native Mac client).

Typical workflow:
1. On Windows, run `mtg.py` once to produce `mtga_collection.json`.
2. Copy that JSON to wherever you want to work (Mac, Linux, Windows).
3. Launch the GUI and pick which colors to export.

### macOS / Linux setup

```bash
./install.sh
.venv/bin/python3 mtga_export_gui.py
```

`install.sh` creates a local `.venv/` (required on modern macOS/Linux because
the system Python refuses pip installs — PEP 668) and installs `requests` into
it. To launch later, either run the GUI through the venv's Python directly as
above, or activate the venv first:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 mtga_export_gui.py
```

If `tkinter` is missing (common with Homebrew Python), install it first and
re-run `./install.sh`:
- macOS: `brew install python-tk`
- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install python3-tk python3-venv`

### Windows

After running `install.bat` you can also launch the GUI:

```bat
python mtga_export_gui.py
```

### Match modes

- **Any selected color** — include cards that have at least one ticked color
  (e.g. ticking just W picks up mono-white *and* multicolor cards containing
  white).
- **Only selected colors** — include cards whose colors are a subset of the
  ticked colors (good for building a guild/shard pool).
- **Exactly the ticked colors** — strict match, e.g. W+U returns only
  Azorius cards.

Color data is fetched once from Scryfall's bulk catalog and cached in
`color_cache.json`, so subsequent filters are instant.
